I have an interest in higher education, so I decided to compare some higher education data from the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR).

Question:

Of the top 100 world ranked universities (as of 2015), does ranked quality of education at the top 25 result in higher alumni employment than the the bottom 25 universities?

Data Definitions:
World Rank: 7 indicators make up a university's rank: quality of education, alumni employment, quality of faculty, research output, quality publications, influence, citations

The two indicators compared in this project are:

Quality of Education: measured by the number of a university's alumni who have won major international awards, prizes, and medals relative to the university's size (15%)

Alumni Employment: measured by the number of a university's alumni who have held CEO positions at the world's top companies relative to the university's size (15%)

To Run This Project:

This project was created in Jyputer Notebook with Anaconda/Python. Imported libraries include SQ Lite 3, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Numpy.

To view the project on your machine, clone the repository, then open the .ipynb file using Jyputer Notebook.
